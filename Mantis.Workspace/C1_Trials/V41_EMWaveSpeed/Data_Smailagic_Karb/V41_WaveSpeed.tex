        Given the wide usage of coaxial cables, a better understanding of their transmittance properties as well as possible limitations is of high importance.
        In this paper, we examine two methods that allow measuring key properties such as damping and propagation velocity by rather simple means.
        The goal is to compare the methods and find which one is more reliable and versatile.
        
        The first method makes use of pulses whose reflections can be looked at on the oscilloscope.
        The behaviour and shape of the reflections can be altered by different resistors at the reflective end, therefore allowing
        the impedance to be calculated.
        We demonstrated this with a cable with an impedance of $Z=50\,\Omega$ per factory specification [1].
        The measured value is $Z=\resistanceMean$.
        The method was then used to measure the propagation velocity of signals inside the coaxial cable at $200\,$kHz which was calculated to be $v_{\text{Runtime}}=\velocityRuntime$.
        And we showed that it could be used for similar measurements as well by measuring the speed of light in air - resulting in $c=\SpeedOfLight \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} $.
        This shows the versatility of the method, since it can be used over a wide range of frequencies.
        One drawback of this method is that it can only be used in an environment where the dispersion relation does not play a huge role.
        For that reason, this method does not allow the damping to be determined quantitavely.
        The second method uses standing waves inside the cable.
        The properties of the waves allow for conclusions about the propagation velocity.
        Since the efects of the dispersion relation dont play a huge role here, it allows for calculating the damping.
        The drawback here is that the method can not be used over such a wide frequency range, and it can only be used for discrete frequencies - corresponding to the harmonics of standing waves.

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    The widespread usage of coaxial cables makes it important to understand their properties but also their limitations,
    like the bad performance at high frequencies or the possibility of perturbations due to reflections at the end of the cable.
    Here, we will look at two different approaches which allow for measurement of the propagation velocity and the damping inside these cables.
    
    Coaxial cables are a type of electrical cable consisting of an inner conductor surrounded by a cylindrical conducting shield(usually copper) seperated by a dielectric. 
    In an ideal coaxial cable, the electromagnetic field carrying the signals (electromagnetic waves) only exist in the space between the conductor and the shield allowing for almost no power losses.
    In this paper we want to examine the transmittance properties of coaxial cables while emphasizing the two used methods and comparing the methods between each other.
    
    \section{Wave propagation in cables - The coaxial cable}
    The transmission properties of a coaxial cable are characterized by the capacitance between the two conductors per unit length $C^*$ and inductance per unit length $L^*$.
    From the Kirchhoff laws for electric circuits the voltage and current in the cable can be derived:
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\partial^2U}{\partial x^2}=L^*C^*\frac{\partial^2U}{\partial t^2}\\
        \frac{\partial^2I}{\partial x^2}=L^*C^*\frac{\partial^2I}{\partial t^2}
    \end{align*}
    These are wave equations with the wave propagation velocity
    \begin{align}
        \label{coaxial:vel}
        v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L^*C^*}}.
    \end{align}
    Since we know the geometry, we can calculate the inductance as well as the capacitance of the coax cable.
    \begin{align}
        C^* = 2\pi\epsilon_0\epsilon_r (\ln(\frac{d_a}{di}))^{-1}\endline
        L^* = \frac{\mu_r\mu_0}{2\pi}\ln(\frac{d_a}{d_i})
        \end{align}
    By inserting the expressions for L* and C* for a coaxial cable with relative permittivity $\epsilon_r$ and relative magnetic permeability $\mu_r$ we obtain
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:vavePropagationVelocity}
        v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}},
    \end{align}
    where c is the speed of light in vacuum.
    Though there is negligible ohmic resistance, coaxial cables still have an impedance of
    \begin{align}
        Z=\sqrt{\frac{L^*}{C^*}}
    \end{align}
    The reflection coefficient $\rho$, which describes the ratio between the amplitude of the incident and the reflected wave at the end of the cable, is given by
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:coaxRef}
        \rho=\frac{R-Z}{R+Z}
    \end{align}
    where $R$ is a resistor at the end of the cable.
    \section{Pulse method}
    In this method, voltage pulses of known frequency and amplitude are sent through the coaxial cable.
    The reflections of these pulses can then be looked at on the oscilloscope.
    From the delay between initial and reflected pulse, the velocity can be determined.
    At one end of the cable (referred to as the generator/cable near end) a function generator of the type Keysight 33220A (with an output impedance of $50\,\Omega$)
    was connected,as well as CH1 of a Tektronix TDS 1001B two-channel oscilloscope
    (with an input impedance of $1\,\text{M}\Omega$).
    The other end of the cable (referred to as the generator/cable far end) was connected to CH2 of the oscilloscope.
    For this experiment we used $30\,$ns pulses generated by the frequency generator at $200\,$kHz and an amplitude of $5\,$V\@.
    The pulses were sent through the coaxial cable and the delay of the reflected pulses was measured with the oscilloscope.
    The experimental setup can be seen in \autoref{fig:Construction}.

            The two channels of a Tektronix TDS 1001B oscilloscope were connected to the two Resistors $R_{\text{Near/Far}}$ which are at the ends of the cable.
            By changing the resistance at the ends of the cable, different reflection behaviour of the pulses can be observed on the oscilloscope reading.

    \subsection{Runtime measurement}
    \label{subsec:runtimeMeasurement}
    For this measurement we used the setup from \autoref{fig:Construction} with $R_{\text{Near}}=50\,\Omega$ and $R_{\text{Far}}=\infty$.
    The open end was used to reflect the signal.
    The time it takes the signal to travel back and forth through the cable was measured with the cursor of the oscilloscope.
    Since the length of the coaxial cable was given to be $50\,$m we used the following formula to determine the velocity
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:runtimeVelocity}
        v=\frac{2l}{\Delta t}
    \end{align}
    which came out to be $v = \velocityRuntime$ at a frequency of $200\,$kHz.
    According to \autoref{eq:vavePropagationVelocity} and assuming $\mu_r = 1$, this velocity corresponds to a relative permittivity $\epsilon_R = \epsilonRRuntime$.
    
    The same method was then used with another cable called the retardation cable.
    The retardation cable has a retardation of $19\,$ns per cm.
    Its length was measured to be l = $\lengthRetardation$.
    We obtained a value of $\vRetRuntime$ at a frequency of $f = 4\,$kHz.
    The expected retardation was $\expectedRetardation\,$s but our measured delay was $(2.080\pm 0.10)\cdot10^{-6}\,$s.
    The values do not coincide within their errors by a tiny margin.
    It is important to keep in mind that the retardation itself is also frequency dependent and perhaps we should have used a different frequency in order to compare the results.
    Since the retardation cable has a much higher damping coefficient than our previous coaxial cable,
    the pulse gets deformed a lot and gets considerably wider.
    This is due to the damping of higher frequencies, making the pulse narrower in the frequency domain but wider in the time domain.
    Therefore, the point at which the pulse begins can not be determined absolutely.
    The much slower propagation speed inside the retardation cable is due to the fact that the retardation cable contains materials with high magnetic permeability $\mu_r$ compared to the $\mu_r \approx 1 $ of
    common coaxial cables, which results in a lower velocity, as can be seen in \autoref{eq:vavePropagationVelocity}.
    The systematic errors which arise in this experiment, are hard to avoid since the frequency -- pulse width uncertainty is central in physics.
    This is a key drawback of this method and also the reason why the damping can only be approximated but not calculated quantitatively.
    Nonetheless, using wider pulses would allow for some of the effects to be small or even negligible.
    \subsection{Measurement of the speed of light}
    \label{subsec:speedOfLightMeasurement}
    In this experiment the speed of light was determined using an light pulse generated by an LED, and a receiver connected to an oscilloscope.
    The LED was set to generate $20\,$ns wide pulses [1].
    The pulses were reflected by a mirror placed at a known distance from the diode.
    The time it took it to travel the distance was measured with the cursors of the oscilloscope.
    From a total of 9 different measured distances, the speed of light was calculated to:
    \begin{align}
        c = \SpeedOfLight \frac{m}{s}
    \end{align}
    The obtained value coincides with the literature value $c  = 2.99742458\cdot10^8 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ [3] within one percent.
    The uncertainty is largely due to the uncertainty in the time measurement since the significant raise in signal from the noise was decided subjectively.
    The graphical representation of the data is depicted in \autoref{fig:regressionFigure}.

            The runtime of a $20\,$ns laser pulse produced by a special LED was measured for 9 different distances.
            A receiver was connected to an oscilloscope allowing to measure the time difference between the initial pulse and its reflection.
            By method of linear gaussian regression, a straight line was fitted to the data, allowing us to determine the speed of light by its incline.
            The obtained value is $c =\SpeedOfLight \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$.

    \label{sec:reflectionProperties}
    \subsection{Reflection phenomena inside the cable}
    Now we do not want to look only at the delay of the reflected pulse, but also at its shape.
    In order to examine the reflection behaviour we make use of \autoref{eq:coaxRef} which suggests, that the reflection
    coefficient $\rho$ depends on the resistance at the end of the cable.
    
    The pulses were then recorded with the oscilloscope while the resistance at the far end of the cable was varied to simulate an open or fixed end.
    The used resistors varied from $R=0\,\Omega $ realized by a short circuit, to $R=50\,\Omega$ and $R=\infty$ realized by leaving the end of the cable open.
    
    Using the setup from \autoref{fig:Construction}, pictures of the voltages shown on the oscilloscope for all of the possible resistor combinations $R_{\text{Near}}, R_{\text{Far}} \in \{\, 0,50\,\Omega,\infty\ \,\}$ can be taken.
    As we know from analogous phenomena -- like waves on a string -- waves behave differently depending on whether the end of the string is fixed or not.
    From \autoref{eq:coaxRef} we know that the reflection coefficient is $\rho = 0 $ for $R = Z$ and $\rho = 1 $ for $R \to \infty$ meaning that the different resistors simulate fixed and loose ends respectively.
    To show this experimentally, we start with no resistor at the generator far end, $R_{\text{Far}} = \infty$.
    From \autoref{eq:coaxRef} we expect the complete reflection of the Signal or $\rho = 1$ and a doubling in amplitude at the generator far end.
    In order to minimize reflections on the generator near end, since we want to examine the influence of the resistor at the far end, we set $R_{\text{Near}}$ to 50$\,\Omega$.
    This can be seen in \autoref{fig:NoResistorFarEnd}.

            The pulses are inside a $50\,$m long coaxial cable with a wave impedance of $50\,\Omega$ per factory specification [1].
            The used frequency is $f=200\,$kHz and the resistor values $R_{\text{Near}}=50\,\Omega$ and $R_{\text{Far}} = \infty$.
            
                CH 1: At the near end of the cable, the amplitude of the reflected signal allows for approximation of the damping due to ohmic resistance.
                By looking at CH1 and comparing the initial amplitude (left) with the reflected amplitude on (right), we approximate the amplitude of the reflected signal as being $35\%$ of the amplitude on CH2.
                This would mean that an amplitude at the end would be $60\%$ of the initial one.
                
                CH 2: With the damping in mind the amplitude at the far end of the cable would not show doubling of the initial amplitude but $120\%$ of it.
                The initial $5\,$V would then be $6\,$V.
                This is what we observe.}   
            \label{fig:NoResistorFarEnd}                                      
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    The amplitude at the end (CH2) should double.
    This can not be exactly seen due to damping inside of the cable which follows an exponential decay.
    By looking at CH1 and comparing the amplitude to the reflected signal, we approximate the reflected wave to be $35\%$ of the initial amplitude.
    This would mean, that the amplitude at the far end of the cable should be $60\%$ of the initial one.
    If we then keep in mind that the incoming amplitude at the end should double, we would expect to see $120\%$ of the initial amplitude to be observed on CH2.
    This is what we observe.
    The small deformations in the initial signal which can be seen in all following measurements, are caused by the pulse generator.
    The deformations of the reflected pulse however, are not coursed by the equipment, but are due to the intrinsic frequency -- pulse width uncertainty relation.
    The initial pulse has a finite width, making it also finitely wide in the frequency domain.
    Since higher frequencies get damped more, the reflected pulse is made up of fewer frequencies making it wider in the time domain.
    This can be seen in \autoref{fig:VanishingReflectionFarEnd} and \autoref{fig:NoResistorFarEnd} as well.
    As already mentioned in \autoref{subsec:runtimeMeasurement}, this is a considerable drawback of the method.
    
    By setting $R_{\text{Far}} = 0\,\Omega$ i.e by a short circuit plug, we continue our observations.
    From \autoref{eq:coaxRef} we expect a reflection coefficient of $\rho = -1$ and thereby a vanishing amplitude at the far end of the cable.
    This is analogous to a fixed end of a string which forces a node at that point.
    This is shown in \autoref{fig:ShortCircuitFarEnd}.

    As we can see from this experiment the reflections of waves on the resistors can pose problems since they can interfere with the incoming signals or even be mistaken with them.
    Therefore, tying to minimize reflections is a must.
    \autoref{eq:coaxRef} predicts a vanishing reflection at exactly $R=Z$ or in this case $R \approx 50\,\Omega$.
    This would also mean that the signal at the generator far end would be just the incoming signal since there is nothing to interfere with it.
    \autoref{fig:VanishingReflectionFarEnd} shows exactly that behaviour, besides the damping due to ohmic resistance which is omnipresent in these measurements.

    \subsection{Wave impedance in coaxial cables}
    As mentioned before, \autoref{eq:coaxRef} predicts a vanishing reflection at exactly $R=Z$, and since we want to measure the impedance of the cable ourselves, we vary $R_{\text{Far}}$ until the reflected pulse is minimal.
    We then measure the resistance of $R_{\text{Far}}$ afterwards.
    Since $R_{\text{Near}}$ is not important for this measurement, we set it to $R_{\text{Near}}=50\,\Omega$ as this would also minimize unwanted reflections.
    This was done for 4 different types of resistors, and the results are given in Tab. \autoref{tab:impedance}

    During the measurement, it was not always possible to reach completely vanishing reflections at the far end of the cable, making the values uncertain.
    The resistance values at which we measured the data, were at the point where the reflected amplitude was the lowest.
    Because of this large uncertainty, the errors of the carbon film potentiometer and the wire wound potentiometer are approximated to be $5\,\Omega$.
    Looking at the data from the two potentiometers, it seems we measured the resistance approximately $5\,\Omega$ to low.
    
    We assume that the problems with reaching a vanishing reflection were due to the internal construction of the potentiometers.
    In case of the potentiometers, one does not simply have a reflection of the wave at the cable/resistor border, but also reflections inside the resistor itself.
    This would cause multiple interfering waves, making unexpected modifications to the signal.
    For that reason, we did not consider the two resistance values of the potentiometers in the calculation of the mean.
    The final value for the impedance of the cable is calculated as the mean of the resistance decade value and the $50\,\Omega$ end plug value.
    The value of the mean is $Z = \resistanceMean$.
    This value suggest that the used coaxial cable was either of type RG-9/U or RG-56/U [4].
    
    \section{Standing wave method}
    \label{subsec:standingWaveMethod}
    The understanding of standing waves will offer an alternative method of calculating the propagation velocity inside the cable which can be calculated via:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:velocityStanding}
        v = f\cdot\lambda
        \end{align}
    with f being the frequency of the wave and $\lambda$ being the wavelength.
    Since the frequency can be controlled with the function generator only the wavelength needs to be determined.
    To determine the wavelength, we make use of the properties of standing waves. 
    
    Standing waves can be created in a coaxial cable by sending a sine signal and letting it be reflected on the far end of the cable.
    Depending on the resistance at the end of the cable, a node at the near end of the cable can only occur if the length is an integer multiple of $\frac{\lambda}{4}$.
    For a fixed end these integers are even while for open ends they are uneven.
    The measurements for $\frac{\lambda}{4},\frac{\lambda}{2}$ and $\frac{3\lambda}{4}$ respectively can be seen in \autoref{tab:standingWaveData}.
    Analogously to the runtime measurement, the velocities and the relative permittivities can be calculated and can be seen in \autoref{tab:standingWaveData} as well.
    As can be seen from the data, the velocity depends on the frequency of the pulse.
    In this experiment we used a cable different to the one in \autoref{sec:propagationVelocities}, because it has a lower damping.
    From the obtained values, we assume the dielectric to be polyethylene whose value is $\epsilon_{R} = 2.25$ at $1\,$KHz [3].
    This would be consistent with specifications of most coaxial cables.

    \subsection{Damping coefficient of coaxial cables}\label{subsec:dampingCoefficient}
    
    Contrary to the assumptions from section 1, physical coaxial cables do have a nonzero ohmic resistance.
    As we have already seen in the oscilloscope data from \autoref{fig:NoResistorFarEnd} - \autoref{fig:VanishingReflectionFarEnd}, the resistance leads to an exponential decay of the signal through the cable.
    The amount of damping is characterised by the damping coefficient
    \begin{align}
       D^*(x) = 20\cdot \frac{1}{x}\log(\frac{U_0}{U(x)})\,\text{dB} 
    \end{align}
    In this experiment we examined the frequency dependence of the damping coefficient.
    As we have a superposition of two waves with different amplitudes, we know that the amplitude at the nodes is | $U(0) - U(2l)$ |, and since the amplitude on the near end of the generator $U(0)$ is known to be $5\,$V
    we can determine $U(2l)$ allowing us to calculate $D^*$.
    The calculated values are given in \autoref{tab:dampingData}.

        \label{tab:dampingData}
    \end{table}
    The data shows that the frequency dependence of the damping is inversely proportional meaning that higher frequencies get damped more.
    The cable acts as a low pass filter.
    This is visualised in \autoref{fig:dampingFigure}.

    This method avoids some problems of the first method, but introduces some new ones.
    Determining the frequencies of standing waves like it was done in this paper is very prone to error.
    The manual adjustments of the frequency when determining the voltage at the nodes is highly uncertain. 
    An alternative would be, not to adjust the nodes at the end of the cable manually but to take data points of the amplitudes and then fit a function to them.
    This would allow for determining the nodes much more accurately.
    Another drawback is the rather large scale at which this method can be done, making it impossible to do a measurement similar to the speed of light measurement we did with the first method.
    
    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
    With both methods, we were able to successfully examine properties of coaxial cables.
    The first method uses pulses which are sent through the cable and measures the runtime.
    We showed that the propagation velocity can be measured which yielded $v_{\text{Runtime}}=\velocityRuntime$ at a frequency of $200\,$kHz,
    and used the same method to determine the velocity of light in air which was measured to be $c=\SpeedOfLight \frac{m}{s}$.
    By doing that, we showed the wide range of frequencies where the method can be used.
    Using different resistors at the ends of our cable, we recreated different reflection phenomena, which then allowed us to 
    find the conditions under which the reflections are minimal.
    This happens to be when the resistance at the end matches the wave impedance of the cable which was measured to be $Z= \resistanceMean $.
    A drawback of this method is that it heavily depends on the dispersion relation, therefore making it impossible to calculate the damping due to the
    frequency -- pulse width uncertainty relation.
    
    The second method uses stranding waves.
    From the properties of standing waves conclusions about the velocity and the damping can be made.
    This method did not allow for the measurement of the wave impedance.
    However, the damping and the propagation velocity could be measured for 3 different frequencies, allowing a nonlinear dispersion relation to be observed.
    This is due to the fact, that the value of $\epsilon_{\text{R}}$ of the dielectric in the cable, changes with frequency, which could also be verified via measurement.
    This method does avoid the problems of the first method, but introduces some new ones.
    Determining the frequencies of standing waves like it was done in this paper is very prone to error.
    An alternative would be, not to adjust the nodes at the end of the cable manually but to take data points of the amplitudes and then fit a function to them.
    This would allow for determining the nodes much more accurately.
    Another drawback is the rather large scale at which this method can be done, making it impossible to do a measurement similar to the speed of light measurement we did with the first method.

    \section{Appendix - Exercises from the instruction}\label{sec:appendix}
    \subsubsection{Numerical example of wave propagation in a cable}
    In this section we will look at a $50\,\si{\m}$ coaxial cable with a capacitance of $C^*=100\,\frac{\si{\pF}}{\si{\m}}$ and an inductance of $L^*=15\cdot 10^{-8}\,\frac{\si{\H}}{\si{\m}}$, where the outer diameter is linked to the inner diameter by $d_a=3d_i$.
    \\\\Following the equations in the instructions \cite{instr}, we find for the time it takes a signal to travel through our cable
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta t=\frac{\Delta x}{v}=\sqrt{L^*C^*}\Delta x = 0,25\,\si{\ms}.
    \end{align*}
    For the relative permittivity we find
    \begin{align*}
        \epsilon_r=L^*C^*c^2= 2,25.
    \end{align*}
    With this result and the assumption that $\mu_r=1$, we can calculate the characteristic impedance
    \begin{align*}
        Z=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_r}{\epsilon_r}\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}}\frac{1}{2\pi}\ln{\frac{d_a}{d_i}}=44,0\,\si{\Omega}
    \end{align*}
    and solving the same equation for $\frac{d_a}{d_i}$ to produce a cable with an impedance of $Z=50\,\si{\Omega}$ results in
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{d_a}{d_i}\big( Z=50\,\si{\Omega} \big ) = 3,54.
    \end{align*}
    \subsubsection{Mathematical description of waves}
    The most simple form of a wave is the monochromatic harmonic real valued wave given by
    \begin{align}\label{eq:simplewave}
    y(x,t)=a\cdot\sin{2\pi\nu\Big(t-\frac{x}{c}\Big)}.
    \end{align}
    The wavelength $\lambda$ is defined as the smallest length satisfying $y(x,t)={y(x+\lambda,t), \forall x,t}$. Plugging this into the wave equation results in the important relation
    \begin{align*}
        c=\lambda\nu,
    \end{align*}
    where c is the propagation velocity of the wave.
    \\\\Adding up two waves of the form in eq.~(\ref{eq:simplewave}), we can first look at the special case where the amplitudes $a_1=a_2=:a$ are the same and only the frequencies differ
    \begin{align}
        y&=y_1+y_2 \nonumber\\&=2a\cos{\Big(2\pi\nu^*\big(t-\frac{x}{c}\big)\Big)}\sin{\Big(2\pi\nu\big(t-\frac{x}{c}\big)\Big)}
        \label{eq:superpos_freq}
    \end{align}
    with $\nu^*:=\frac{\nu_2-\nu_1}{2}$ and $\nu:=\frac{\nu_2+\nu_1}{2}$. This describes a wave with amplitude $2a$, frequency $\nu$ and an envelope of the frequency $\nu^*$, where at the nodes of the envelope, the amplitude vanishes completely.
    Considering the superposition of two waves of the form in eq. \ref{eq:simplewave} with the same frequency $\nu$ but different amplitudes $a_1$ and $a_2$, we find
    \begin{align}
        y&=y_1+y_2\nonumber\\&=(a_1+a_2)\cos{(kx)}\sin{(\omega t)}\nonumber\\&+ (a_1-a_2)\sin{(kx)}\cos{(\omega t)}
        \label{eq:superpos_amp}
    \end{align}
    where $k=\frac{2\pi\nu}{c}$ and $\omega=2\pi\nu$. This is a superposition of standing waves with amplitudes $a_1+a_2$ and $|a_1-a_2|$ and a separation in phase of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Thus, the envelope oscillates between the amplitudes $a_1+a_2$ and $|a_1-a_2|$.\\
    Up to this point, we only considered waves with a linear dispersion and thus constant propagation speed. But in general, the propagation velocity is a function of wavelength $c=c(\lambda)$. Implementing different velocities $c_1=c(\lambda_1)$ and $c_2=c(\lambda_2)$ in eq.~\ref{eq:superpos_freq} and replacing $c_2=c_1-\Delta c$ as well as $\lambda_2=\lambda_1-\Delta\lambda$, where we look at the case of very similar propagation media such that $\Delta\lambda \ll \lambda_1$ and $\Delta c \ll c_1$, we find
    \begin{align}
        y=&2a\cos{\Big(\pi\frac{(\lambda_1\Delta c - \Delta\lambda c_1)\cdot t + \Delta\lambda\cdot x}{\lambda_1^2}\Big)}\nonumber\\&\cdot\sin{\Big(2\pi\frac{c_1\cdot t - x}{\lambda_1}\Big)}.
    \end{align}
    To compare this result with eq.~\ref{eq:superpos_freq}, we can take the limit $\Delta c \to 0$ and approximate $\lambda_1\lambda_2\approx\lambda_1^2$. Inserting $\nu_i=\frac{c_1}{\lambda_i}$, we receive exactly eq.~\ref{eq:superpos_freq}.
