    \section{Introduction}
    Transmitting signals without losses is very important in all branches of everyday life.
    Thus, a better understanding of the established methods of conductance is a must.
    A commonly used mean of signal transmission is the coaxial cable, which is easy to manufacture and due to its construction minimizes energy loss and environmental interference.
    It can be found everywhere, form telephone lines through cable television signals to broadband internet.
    In this paper, we want to examine the propagation properies of singlas - electromagnetic waves, through these cables.
    \section{Theory}
    \subsection{Wave propagation in cables - The coaxial cable}
    Coaxial cables are a type of electrical cable consisting of an inner conductor surrounded by a cylindrical conducting shield(usually copper) seperated by a dielectric. In an ideal coaxial
    cable the electromagnetic field carrying the signals (electromagnetic waves) only exist in the space between the conductor and the shield allowing for almost no power losses making it superior to conventional
    transmission lines. 
    Further, electromagnetic field inside is shielded form fields outside making the cable ideal for carrying weak signals.
    These properties explain the widespread usage of coax cables for both carrying weak signals that must not interfere with the environment as well as strong signals to minimize losses.
    The transmission properties of a coaxial cable are characterized by the capacitance between the two conductors per unit length $C^*$ and inductance per unit length $L^*$
    Form maxwells equations the voltage and current in the cable are given by:
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\partial^2U}{\partial x^2}=L^*C^*\frac{\partial^2U}{\partial t^2}\\
        \frac{\partial^2I}{\partial x^2}=L^*C^*\frac{\partial^2I}{\partial t^2}
    \end{align*}
    These are wave equations with the wave propagation velocity
    \begin{align}
        \label{coaxial:vel}
        v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L^*C^*}}.
    \end{align}
    Since we know the geometry, we can calculate the inductance as well as the capacitance of the coax cable.
    \begin{align}
        C^* = 2\pi\epsilon_0\epsilon_r (\ln(\frac{d_a}{di}))^{-1}\endline
        L^* = \frac{\mu_r\mu_0}{2\pi}\ln(\frac{d_a}{d_i})
        \end{align}
    By inserting the expressions for L* and C* for a coaxial cable with relative permittivity $\epsilon_r$ and relative magnetic permeability $\mu_r$ we obtain
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:vavePropagationVelocity}
        v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}},
    \end{align}
    where c is the speed of light in vacuum.
    Though there is negligible ohmic resistance, coaxial cables still have an impedance of
    \begin{align}
        Z=\sqrt{\frac{L^*}{C^*}}
    \end{align}
    and the reflection coefficient $\rho$, which describes the ratio between the amplitude of the incident and the reflected wave, is given by
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:coaxRef}
        \rho=\frac{R-Z}{R+Z}
    \end{align}
    where $R$ is a resistor at the end of the cable.

    The broad experimental setup can be seen in Fig.1

    \section{Wave properties in the coax cable}
    In this section we examine the shape of electromagnetic pulses and their reflections on resistors on the far end of the generator.
    Furthermore we examine the properties of these pulses, measuring the time it takes a signal to reflect on the far end of the cable and come back as well as creating a standing wave and counting the wavelengths in the cable to determine the propagation velocity.
    
    \subsection{Reflected pulses}\label{subsec:wave-impedance-in-the-coax}
    We use the setup form Fig.1 and take pictures of the voltages shown on the oscilloscope for all of the possible resistor combinations. $R_{near}, R_{far} \in \{ 0,50,\infty\} \Omega$
    As we know from analogous phenomena (ex. waves on a string), waves behave differently depending on if the end of the string is fixed or not.
    From Eq. \ref{eq:coaxRef} we know that the reflection coefficient is 0 for R = Z and 1 for $\lim_{R \to \infty}\rho$ meaning that the different resistors simulate fixed and loose ends respectively.
    To show this experimentally, we start with no resistor at the generator far end, $R_{far} = \infty$.
    From \ref{eq:coaxRef} we expect the complete reflection of the Signal or $\rho = 1$ and a doubling in amplitude.
    To minimize reflections on the generator near end, since we want to examine the influence of the resistor at the far end, we set $R_{near}$ to 50$\Omega$.
    This can be seen in \ref{fig:NoResistorFarEnd}
    \begin{figure}[htbp]                                 %So bindet man Graphiken ein

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    \textit{The figure does not show that due to damping effects. The general trend however is still visible. Some deformation can also be seen, that can be explained by taking the capacitance and inductance of the used cables into account}
    
    Now we use the short circuit plug at the generator far end and expect From Eq. \ref{eq:coaxRef} a reflection coefficient of -1 and a vanishing amplitude at the generator far end.
    This is analogous to a fixed end which forces a node.
    This is shown in \ref{fig:ShortCircuitFarEnd}, with the damped amplitude.
    \begin{figure}[htbp]                                 %So bindet man Graphiken ein

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    As we can see form this experiment the reflections of waves on the resistors can pose problems since they can interfere with the incoming signals or even be mistaken with them.
    Eq. \ref{eq:coaxRef} predicts a vanishing reflection at exactly $R=Z$ or in this case R$\approx 50\Omega$, this would also mean that the signal at the generator far end would be just the incoming signal since there is nothing to interfere with it.
    Fig \ref{fig:VanishingReflectionFarEnd} shows exactly that behaviour, besides the damping which is omnipresent in these measurements.

    \subsection{Wave impedance in coaxial cables}
    
    As mentioned before, Eq. \ref{eq:coaxRef} predicts a vanishing reflection at exactly R=Z, and since we want to measure the impedance of the cable ourselves, we vary $R_{far}$ until the reflected pulse is minimal and measure the resistance of $R_{far}$ afterwards.
    Since $R_{near}$ is not important for this measurement, we set it to $R_{near}=50\Omega $ as this would also minimize unwanted reflections.
    This was done for 4 different types of resistors, and the results are given in Tab. \ref{tab:impedance}

    As can be seen from the data, the measured values do not coincide within their errors. The erros were approximated as it was not possible to reach completely wanishing reflections making the measurements uncertain.
    We assume that Eq \ref{eq:coaxRef} does not hold here due to the internal construction of the two potentiometers which possibly introduces an extra inductive impedance.
    The final value for the impedance of the cable is calculated as the mean of these values giving Z=
    \section{Propagation velocities of waves in coaxiall cables}
    \subsection{Runtime measurement}
    For this measurement we used the setup from Fig \ref{fig:Aufbau} with $R_{near}=50\Omega and R_{far}=\infty \Omega $.
    The open end was used to reflect a signal and measure the time it takes the signal to travel the length of the cable two times.
    The time difference was measured with the cursors of the oszilloscope.
    This was done for both the coaxiall cable as well as the retardation cable we had available.
    Since the length of the  coaxiall cable was given to be 50m we used the following formula to determine the velocity
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:runtimeVelocity}
        v=\frac{2l}{\Delta t}
        \end{align}
    which came out to be v=$\velocityRuntime$ at a frequency of 200KHz.
    According to Eq \ref{eq:vavePropagationVelocity} and assuming $\mu_r = 1$, this velocity corresponds to a relative permittivity $\epsilon_R$ = $\epsilonRuntime$.
    \endline
    For the retardation cable, the measured length was $\lengthRetardation$ which corresponds to a velocity of $\vRetRuntime$ at a frequency of f $\approx$ 4KHz.
    This can be explained by the fact that the retardation cable contains materials with high magnetic permeability $\mu_r$ compared to the $\mu_r \approx 1 $ of common coaxial cables, which results in a lower velocity as can be seen in Eq. \ref{eq:vavePropagationVelocity}.
    \subsection{Standing wave measurement}
    \label{subsec:standingWaveMeasurement}
    The Understanding of standing waves will offer an alternative method of  calculating the propagation speed of the waves in the cable.
    The propagation velocity of waves can be calculated via:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:velocityStanding}
        v = f\cdot\lambda
        \end{align}
    with f being the frequency of the wave and $\lambda$ being the wavelength.
    Since the frequency can be controlled with the function generator only the wavelength needs to be determined.
    To determine the wavelength, we make use of the properties of standing waves. 
    \subsubsection{Model experiment}
    The two outputs of the Generator (41-16) are connected to the two channels of the oscilloscope and using math mode internally added.
    As shown in Appendix \ref{}, superposing two opposing sine waves of the same frequency and amplitude results in a standing wave.
    Since the Amplitudes of the initial waves are equal, the standing wave has nodes with amplitude zero, otherwise some amplitude always remains.
    This behaviour was observed and an example of the visualized image can be seen in Fig \ref{fig:standingWaves}

    \Section{Damping koefficient of koaxiall cables}
    Contrary to the assumptions from section 1, physical coaxial cables do have a nonzero ohmic resistance.
    As we have already seen in the oszillator data from Fig. 2-4, the reseistance leads to an exponential decay of the signal through the cable.
    The amount of damping is characterised by the damping coefficient
    \begin{align}
       D^* = 20\cdot \frac{1}{x}\log(\frac{U_0}{U_x}) dB 
    \end{align}
    In this experiment we examined the frequancy dependence of the damping coefficient.
    The setup from \ref{subsec:standingWaveMeasurement} was used to measure the minimal amplitude of the signal.
    As we have a superposition of two waves with different amplitudes, we know that the amplitude at the nodes is | $U(0) - U(2l)$ |, and since the amplitude on the near end of the generator U(0) is known
    we can determine U(2l) allowing us to calculate $D^*$.
    The calculated values are given in Tab. 
    \begin{table}
            \centering
            \caption{}
            \label{tab:dampingData}

    \hline
    \hline   
            \end{tabular*}
        \end{table}
    The data shows that the frequency dependence of the damping is inversely proportional meaning that higher frequencies get damped more.
    The cable acts as a low pass filter.
