        We present a method for studying the fundamental polarization properties of electromagnetic waves in
        the visible spectrum.
        First we want to introduce a setup, with which we can create and observe linear and
        circular polarized light.
        We use conventional polarizing filters to create linear polarized light.
        By appling the Jones' formalism, we can derive Malus' law, which we
        then show experimentally.
        Furthermore, with \quaterWavePlates we produce circular polarized light.
        We demonstrate its properties qualitatively.
        
        In the second part, we showcase two exemplary applications.
        Since sugar molecules are chiral, they are optical active, meaning a
        sugar solutions rotates linear polarized light.
        We measure the specific optical rotation of sucrose $\specRot = \sugarSpecificOpticalRotation$
        with a half-shade polarimeter and then apply it for determining the concentration of 
        an unknown sucrose solution.
        
        Similar to optical activity of chiral molecules functions the Faraday effect.
        Here we apply a magnetic field at a \NSF-glas rod and shine linear polarized light
        through it.
        We gauge the space-resolved magnetic field with a hall sensor and then measure the rotated 
        polarization vector of the transmitted light with a linear polarizing filter.
        We determine Verdet's constant for three wavelengths $\VOne = \verdetConstantOne$,
        $\VTwo = \verdetConstantTwo$ and $\VThree = \verdetConstantThree$.

    \section{Methods to create and detect polarized light}
    \subsection{Introduction}
    In classical physics light is described as an electromagnetic wave.
    The electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the propagation direction.
    The polarization refers to the direction of the electric field.
    If the wave is linear polarized, the field oscillates in a fixed plane.
    If the wave is circular polarized, the field vector rotates around the propagation direction.
    
    The polarization of light can be described with the Jones' formalism~\cite{gerth}.
    Linear polarized light is denoted with a real vector, pointing in the polarization direction.
    For example vertical and horizontal polarized light:
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{J}_H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad
        \vec{J}_V = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    
    Furthermore, left and right circular polarized light are described with a complex vector:

    \begin{align*}
        \vec{J}_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix} \quad
        \vec{J}_R = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    
    Optical devices such as polarizing filters and \quaterWavePlates are described with matrices, which act
    upon the polarization vector $\vec{J}$. 
    
    \subsection{Linear polarization -- Malus' law}
    \label{subsec:MalusLaw}
    
    \figMalusFit{
    Linear v-polarized light is shone upone a polarizing filter, which is rotated around the angle $\Theta$.
    The resulting intensity is measured by a photo diode. 
        Its output current, which is proportional to the intensity, is depicted in the graphic.
    The intensity follows Malus' law ~\eqref{eq:theoMaluslaw}.
    We fit it in the dataset, with the default intensity $I_0$ and the offset angle $\Theta_0$ as
    free parameters.
    It is evident that Malus' law holds.
    This method can be used to determine the polarization angle $\Theta_0$ of a linear
    polarized light source as for example in ~\autoref{subsec:Faraday}
    }
    
    A linear polarizing filter is denoted in Jones' formalism with the matrix:
    \begin{align*}
        P_{\Theta} = \begin{pmatrix} sin^2\Theta & - cos\Theta sin\Theta \\
                        - cos\Theta sin\Theta & cos^2\Theta \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    Where $\Theta$ is the angle between the polarizing filter and the y-axis.
    If we let v-polarized light shine on the polarizing filter, it will be partially be absorbed.
    We can get the resulting intensity by calculate the magnitude of the Jones' vector:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:theoMaluslaw}
        \vec{J} &= P_{\Theta} \vec{J}_V = \begin{pmatrix} -cos\Theta sin\Theta \\
                                               cos^2\Theta\end{pmatrix} \\
        I &\propto | \vec{J} |^2 = cos^2(\Theta) 
    \end{align}
    This is Malus' law.
    We want to verify this law.
    
    In our setup we use an incandescent electric lamp, which emits unpolarized light in the full
    visible range.
    We polarize it by placing a linear polarizing filter in front of the lamp.
    A second polarizing filter, the analysator, is mounted behind that.
    It is rotated about the angle $\Theta$ relative to the first polarizing filter.
    A photo diode detects the resulting intensity.
    We measure its output current, which is proportional to the intensity.
    
    The data is shown in ~\autoref{fig:MalusFit}.
    We fit the function:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:malusFit}
        I = I_0 cos^2(\Theta + \Theta_0)
    \end{align}
     Where $I_0$ and $\Theta_0$ denote free parameters.
    From the graphic it is evident, that the data follows Malus' law.
    
    An application of this law is to determine the polarization angle $\Theta_0$ of an unknown
    linear polarized light source.
    By rotating the analysator around the whole $360\degree$ range and measuring the
    resulting intensity, the unknown angle $\Theta_0$ can be determined.
    This method could be applied in the Faraday experiment of ~\autoref{subsec:Faraday}.
    
    Furthermore, another improvement would be to make $I_0$ not a free parameter, but to calculate it
    via the photo diode's device specifications.
    This would enable more quantitative statements.
    Here we are satisfied with the simpler method,
    since the qualitative results do suffice for the purposes of this paper.
    
    \subsection{Circular polarization}
    
    In a circular polarized, electromagnetic wave, the electric field vector rotates around the
    propagation direction of the wave.
    Circular polarized light can be created by shining diagonal polarized light upon a \quaterWavePlate.
    A \quaterWavePlate consists of an optical anisotropic material, where the propagation speed for
    v-polarized light, differs in comparison to h-polarized light.
    This results in a phase shift between the x- and y-component of the electromagnetic wave.
    If the \quaterWavePlate has the right thickness, so the shift between the x- and y-component
    is exactly $\frac{\pi}{2}$, we can convert d-polarized light into circular polarized light.
    
    In Jones' formalism a \quaterWavePlate is represented by the matrix:
    \begin{align*}
        Q_{\frac{\lambda}{4}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix} 
    \end{align*}
    If d-polarized light is shone upon the \quaterWavePlate it is converted to right circular light:
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{J} &= Q_{\frac{\lambda}{4}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
        \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    This only works if the light has the right wavelength $\lambda$, matching the 
    \quaterWavePlate.
    
    To demonstrate this relationship, we mount an interference filter before our lamp
    to get monochromatic light: $\lambda = \wavelengthYellow$.
    After it, we mount a linear polarizing filter to produce d-polarized light.
    Then the \quaterWavePlate is installed with a relative angle of $45 \degree$ to the polarizing filter.
    The resulting circular light can then be observed with a second linear polarizing filter, the analysator.
    For any orientation of the polarizing filter, the same amount of light passes through.
    The \quaterWavePlates we used in our experiment, are optimized for Natrium-D-Lamps,
    so for light of the wavelength $\lambda = 589 \nm$.
    This means we do not actually get circular polarized light, but elliptical light.
    We observe it, when rotating the analysator, the light passing through varies, depending on
    the orientation of the analysator.
    
    By placing a second \quaterWavePlate behind the first one, we get a \halfWavePlate.
    A \halfWavePlate can described with:
    \begin{align*}
        Q_{\frac{\lambda}{2}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    It has the effect, that it mirrors linear polarized light around the y-axis.
    
    We can demonstrate it by shing light with a polarization angle $\Theta$ and observing 
    that the resulting light has the polarization $-\Theta$.
    Again we have the problem that monochromatic light from the interference filter, has
    not the correct wavelength for the \halfWavePlate.
    This means we also get slightly elliptical polarized light.
    
    This experiment could be improved by using a laser instead of an interference filter,
    since the interference filter has a bandwidth of wavelengths.
    In contrast, a laser is monochromatic, with only a very small bandwidth.
    
    \subsection{Birefringence with a calcite crystal}

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Positively_birefringent_material}
        \centering
        \caption{
        The graphic shows the principle of birefringent materials.
        We have a optical anisotropic material, where p-polarized light is refracted
        differently than s-polarized light.
        The s-polarized light is parallel to the optical axis (and is in the graphic called
            `parallel polarized').
        It is refrected under a greater angle and becomes the extraordinary ray,
            while p-polarized light sees a smaller refractive index and results in
        the ordinary ray. Image source~\cite{birefringenceGraphic}}
        \label{fig:birefringent}
    \end{figure}
    
    In optical anisotrop materials, the refractive index differs for light polarized
    parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis.
    This leads to the effect of birefringence, where the incoming light ray is split into 
    two -- an ordinary and extraordinary ray.
    The effect is shown in ~\autoref{fig:birefringent}.
    In the graphic one may observe that s-polarized light is greater refracted,
    resulting in the extraordinary ray,
    while p-polarized light has a smaller refractive angle.
    
    In our experiment we mount a calcite crystal, which is fixed inside a fringe,
    before our incandescent lamp. 
    We observe two light ray on the detection screen.
    The ordinary and extraordinary ray can be distinguished by rotating the cristal.
    We observe that the extraordinary ray rotates around the ordinary, since it has a 
    greater refractive angle.
    If we mount a linear polarizing filter after the calcite crystal, we can see that both rays are
    polarized, with a perpendicular polarization direction.
    
    For the experiment one has to pay attention that the incoming light ray is neither parallel nor
    perpendicular to the optical axis of the calcite crystal. 
    In both cases you would not see the split-up between the ordinary and extraordinary ray,
    since then you would only have one refractive index for the ray.
    
    \section{Applications}
    In the first part we showcased simple setups to create and detected polarized light.
    In the second part we now want to present two possible applications of those setups,
    for investigating advanced effects.
    \subsection{Optical activity}
    A chiral molecule does not posses an intrinsic mirror symmetry.
    If you have a solution with a greater amount of one type than its mirrored counterpart,
    the solution is optical active.
    It means right circular light has a different refractive index than left circular light.
    If you shine linear polarized light through an optical active solution, the
    polarization vector gets tilted around a specific angle $\Delta \Theta$.
    The angle $\Delta \Theta$ depends on the distance $l$ travelled through the solution,
    the concentration of the molecule $c$, and the specific optical rotation $\alpha$:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:specificOpticalRotation}
        \Delta \Theta = \alpha \, c \, l
    \end{align}
    The specific optical rotation $\alpha$ depends on the molecule and the wavelength of the light.
    
    In our experiment we want to determine the specific rotation of sucrose.
    For this, we use our incandescent lamp and mount the $\wavelengthYellow$ interference monochromator
    before it.
    Then the light is polarized with a linear polarizing filter and shines through
    a glas tube, containing the sugar solution.
    The glas tube has the length $l = \sugarGlasTubeLength$.
    The tilted angle $\Delta \Theta$ is then measured with a half-shade polarimeter.
    
    A half-shade polarimeter is a device consisting of two linear polarizing filters, which are mounted
    with a relative angle $\Delta \varphi$ next to each other.
    We first want to determine the relative angle $\Delta \varphi$ and the default angle $\Theta_0$ of
    the light's polarization vector.
    To do this, we remove the glas tube, containing the sugar solution, and measure the angle 
    $\varphi_1$, where the first polarizing filter lets all light pass, and $\varphi_2$, where
    the second filter lets all light pass.
    From a measurement series containing five data-points, we can determine the relative angle
    and the default angle:
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta \varphi & = \varphi_2 - \varphi_1 & = & \quad \halfShadowAngle \\
        \Theta_0 & = \frac{\varphi_1 + \varphi_2}{2} & = & \quad \defaultAngle
    \end{align*}
    The errors are derived from the variance of the measurement series and then propagated with
    the variance formula~\cite{errorPropagation} (also refered as gaussian error propagation).
    This procedure is always applied unless stated otherwise.
    
    We now want to measure the specific optical rotation.
    We insert the glas tube back into the apparatus.
    It contains a sugar solution with a concentration $c = \referenceConcentration$.
    We now measure the angle $\Theta$ of the rotated polarization vector.
    We do this by rotating the two polarizing filters of the polarimeter, so both let the same amount of
    light pass (they appear with the same brightness).
    We can calculate the relative rotation $\Delta \Theta$ and with equation ~\eqref{eq:specificOpticalRotation}
    we can determine the specific optical rotation:
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta Theta &= \Theta - \Theta_0 &= \referenceRotationAngle \\
        \specRot &= \sugarSpecificOpticalRotation
    \end{align*}
    
    The resulting value is consistent with the literature value:
    \begin{align*}
        [\alpha]_{589\nm} = 6.65 \unit{\frac{\degree \, cm^2}{g}} ~\cite{instr}
    \end{align*}
    The slight deviation can be contributed to the fact that for the literature value natrium-D-light
    is used, while we use a monochromator with $\lambda = \wavelengthYellow$.
    
    With the measured specific optical rotation we can measure an unknown sucrose concentration.
    We use a thinned-down solution from a different team.
    We measure the rotation angle and with ~\eqref{eq:specificOpticalRotation} we can determine
    the concentration:
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta \Theta &= \testRotationAngle \\
        c &= \sugarTestConcentration
     \end{align*}
    Unexpectedly we see that the concentration is in fact greater than before.
    The group, who gave use their solution, contributed it to the fact that there was some sugar left
    inside the glas with which they have thinned downed their sugar solution.
    So actually increasing the concentration.

    \subsection{Faraday effect}
    \label{subsec:Faraday}

    \newcommand{\BMean}{\bar{B}}
    \newcommand{\BMax}{B_{\mathrm{max}}}

    The Faraday effect occurs when a magnetic field is applied at a dielectric, such as glas.
    If light travels parallel to the B-field through the dielectric, the refractive index
    for left and right circular light differs, depending on the field strength.
    It is caused by the Zeeman effect, where the degenerate atomic energy levels are splitting up.
    Because of the dipole-transition rule, left and right circular light couple differently to the atoms.
    The difference in the refractive index between left and right circular light leads to a rotation
    $\Theta$ of linear polarized light.
    This is analog to chiral molecules.
    The angle $\Theta$ depends on the length of the dielectric $l$, the field strength $\BMean$ and
    the Verdet constant $V$:


    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:VerdetTheta}
        \Theta &= V \, \BMean \, l
    \end{align}
    The Verdet constant is wavelength dependent and differs for different materials.
    It can be approximated with the formula~\cite{gerth}:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:TheoVerdetCurve}
        V(\lambda) = - \frac{e}{2 m_e c} \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}
    \end{align}
    Here $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ the speed of light and
    $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the transmitted light.
    Further, $n(\lambda)$ is the refractive index of the dielectric.
    It is wavelength dependent and differs for each material.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{FaradaySetup}
        \centering
        \caption{
            The right side showes the setup we used for the Faraday effect.
            The magnetic field of the coils is amplified by the iron yoke, and bend so the magnetic field
            is parallel to the light ray.
            The \NSF-glas rod is placed inserted in the boring of the yoke.
            The light travels through the boring and then through the glas rod.
            The left side of the picture shows the approximate setup to calculate the space-resolved magnetic field.
            For the fit ~\eqref{eq:coilApproximation} we asume that the magnetic field is created by two symetric coils
            with a length $d$ and a distance $a$ from the center.
            The measured field strength as function of $x$ and the approximate fit are depicted in \autoref{fig:fyLocalBField}.
        }
        \label{fig:faradaySetup}
    \end{figure}

    Our experimental setup consists of an incandescent lamp, after it is placed an interference and a
    polarizing filter to create monochrom linear polarized light.
    The light then transits the glas rod.
    We use the dense flint glas \NSF ~\cite{glassTubeDatasheet} from `Schott Advanced Optics'.
    The rod has the length $l = \glasCylinderLength$.
    It is placed inside a boring inside a iron yoke.
    The magnetic field is created by two coils, compare ~\autoref{fig:faradaySetup}.
    A second polarizing filter, the analysator, is placed after the glas rod,
    and a photo diode detects the resulting intensity.

    \figfyLocalBField{For the Faraday effect we use the setup depicted at the left side of ~\autoref{fig:faradaySetup}.
    To measure the B-field at the position of the glas rod, we first remove it from the iron york and
    then insert the axial hall sensor~\cite{hallSensor}.
    We apply the current $I = \CurrentForLocalBField$ and
    for $2\unit{mm}$-intervals record the B-field.
    For the regression we approximate the field, with a magnetic field created by two symmetrical placed coils as
    shown an the right side of ~\autoref{fig:faradaySetup}.
    We fit equation ~\eqref{eq:coilApproximation} in the data and by integrating over the glas rod's length
        $l = \glasCylinderLength$, get the mean field $\BMean = \MeanBField$.}

    In equation ~\eqref{eq:VerdetTheta} it is assumed that the B-field is constant over the whole
    length of the dielectric.
    This is not the case for our setup.
    To account for this fact, we first have to determine the space-resolved magnet field.
    We remove the glas rod from the iron york and
    use the axial hall sensor~\cite{hallSensor} from `PhyWe' to measure the magnetic field.
    It has an accuracy of $\pm 2 \% $.
    We apply a current $I = \CurrentForLocalBField$ at the coils and then measure
    in $2 \unit{mm}$ intervalls the B-Field as a function of $x$.
    The recorded data is depicted in ~\autoref{fig:fyLocalBField}.
    To find a suitable fit, we assume that the magnet field is equal to a magnet field created by two
    coils, which are symmetrical placed along the x-axis (See the left side of ~\autoref{fig:faradaySetup}).
    The coils have the length $d$, the winding number $N$, the radius $R$ and are placed the distance $a$ away from the center.
    The B-field of those coils along the x-axis is:

    \newcommand{\CoilEnd}[1]{\frac{#1}{\sqrt{R^2 + (#1)^2}}}
    \newcommand{\dHalf}{\frac{d}{2}}

    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:coilApproximation}
        B &=  \frac{\mu_0 \, I \, N}{2} \scriptstyle \left( \CoilEnd{x - a - \dHalf} - \CoilEnd{x - a + \dHalf} \\
        & \scriptstyle - \CoilEnd{x + a - \dHalf} + \CoilEnd{x + a +\dHalf} \right)^2
    \end{align}
    Here $d$,$N$,$R$,$a$ and an constant offset $x_0$ are free parameters in the fit.
    The offset $x_0$ is suppressed in ~\eqref{eq:coilApproximation} for clarity

    \newcommand{\xInteg}{\int_{-\lHalf}^{\lHalf} dx \,}

    With the fit we now can calculate the mean B-Field $\BMean$, which we need
    to calculate the Verdet constant in equation ~\eqref{eq:VerdetTheta}.
    We determine it by integrating the fit $B(x)$ over the length $l$ of the glas rod.
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:meanBFieldInt}
        \BMean &= \frac{1}{l} \xInteg B(x) \\
            &= \MeanBField \quad \text{for} \quad I = \CurrentForLocalBField
    \end{align}

    We determine the error by using the covariance matrix emerging from the scattering of the
    data-points around the fit, and then using the variance formula:

    \begin{align*}
        \sigma_{\mathrm{\BMean}} = \frac{1}{l} \left( \xInteg \sigma_{\mathrm{B}}^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
    \end{align*}

    \figfyMeanBField{
        To get the mean B-field as a function of the current $\BMean(I)$, it suffices to measure the
        magnetic field at the maximum $\BMax(I)$ and use \eqref{eq:meanBFromMaxB} to infer the
        mean field, since the magnetic field is proportional to the current $I$.
        The plot shows the from the measured data $\BMax$ calculated mean field $\BMean$.
        We fit a linear function to get the relation $\BMean(I)$.
    }

    In equation ~\eqref{eq:coilApproximation} we observe that the B-Field is proportional to the
    current $I$.
    This means when we now want to determine the mean field $\BMean$ for the entire current range,
    instead of repeating the procedure for every current, it suffices to
    measure the B-Field at just one fixed point and then infer the mean field.
    We chose to measure the B-field at the maximum, since here we have the highest accuracy.
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:meanBFromMaxB}
        \BMean (I) = \frac{\BMax(I)}{\BMax( I = \CurrentForLocalBField)}
    \end{align}

    We measure $\BMax$ over the current range of our coils $I = 0 \dots 3 \unit{A}$.
    The data is depicted in \autoref{fig:fyMeanBField}.
    For high currents we have to pay attention that the coils do not get to hot, since this changes
    the magnetization and subsequent the B-field.
    We fit a linear function in the data and get the B-field as a function of the current.
    It has the slope $s = \MeanBFieldModelmu$ and the offset $m_0 = \MeanBFieldModelm$.
    The offset corresponds to remanence magnetization of the iron york.
    In the following calculations we use the fit as $\BMean(I)$.
    The error is inferred from the regression's covariance matrix.
    
    \figfyAngleDependencePlot{
        The plot depicts the measured polarization vector's rotation angle $\Theta$ as a function of the B-field.
        We use three different intereference filters to create monochromatic light.
        It is polarized and then traverses the \NSF-glas rod, where a magnetic field is applied.
        The Faraday effect causes the polarization vector to rotate.
        We measure the angle with a second polarizing filter, by manually search the intensity minimum.
        It has a high uncertanty $\sigma_\Theta = \fyErrorAngle$.
        We fit equation ~\eqref{eq:VerdetTheta} into the data to get the Verdet constants, which are
        listed in ~\autoref{tab:verdetConstants}.
    }
    
    Now we can start measuring the polarization vector's rotation $\Theta$ caused by the Faraday effect.
    We insert the glas rod back into the iron yoke.
    With an interference and polarizing filter we create monochromatic polarized light, which
    shines through the glas rod. 
    We determine the light's tilted polarization vector with a second polarization filter,
    placed after the glas rod.
    We manually rotate the filter and search for the minimum of the transmitted intensity.
    We estimate the method's error to $\sigma_{\Theta} = \fyErrorAngle$.
    For the coil's current range $0\dots 3 \unit{A}$ we measure the rotation angle $\Theta$.
    This done for three monochromators.
    The data is depicted in ~\autoref{fig:fyAngleDependencePlot}.
    The B-field is calculated with the previous fit \BMean(I).
    By fitting a linear function in the data we can calculate the Verdet-constants which are
    listed in ~\autoref{tab:verdetConstants}.

        \caption{
            For three wavelengths we measure the polarization rotation angle $\Theta$.
            Via a linear fit and with equation ~\eqref{eq:VerdetTheta} 
            we can calculate the Verdet constants, which are listed here.
            The uncertanty derives mainly from the great error, intruduced by manually measureing the
            polarization vector.
            With the approximation ~\eqref{eq:TheoVerdetCurve} and the Sellmeier equation for the
            refractiv index ~\eqref{eq:Sellmeier} we can calculate the theoretical expected verdet
            constants.
            The great discrapancy between the expected and measured values
            may be caused by the manual method of determining the polarization angle, since
            it may lead to systematical errors, which we did not account for in our calculations.
        }
        \label{tab:verdetConstants}
    \end{table}
    
    As can be seen in ~\autoref{fig:fyAngleDependencePlot} the manual method has a high inaccuracy,
    which leads to the great errors of the Verdet constants.
    It is because the intensity's minimum is not easy to find, since it follows Malus' law
    $cos^2\Theta$, which is flat at the extrema.
    
    \figfyVerdetPlot{
    The plot depicts the measured Verdet constants from ~\autoref{tab:verdetConstants} and
    the expected theoretical curve ~\eqref{eq:TheoVerdetCurve}.
    The theoretical curve depends on the refractive index $n(\lambda)$ of the used \NSF-glass.
        It can be calculated with the Sellmeier equation ~\eqref{eq:Sellmeier} and the parameters 
    from the datasheet~\cite{glassTubeDatasheet}.
    In the plot a discrapency between the data and the theoretical value is evident.
    It may be caused by the manual method of determining the polarization angle, since
    it may lead to systematical error, which we did not account for in our calculations.
    }
    
    The measured data points can be compared to the theoretical Verdet constants $\VTheo$.
    We use the Sellmeier-equation to determine the refractive index of the \NSF-glas rod:
    \newcommand{\SellmeierEqPart}[1]{\frac{B_{#1} \, \lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - C_{#1}}}
    
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:Sellmeier}
        n^2(\lambda) = 1 + \SellmeierEqPart{1} + \SellmeierEqPart{2} + \SellmeierEqPart{3}
    \end{align}
    The six constants can be inferred from the datasheet~\cite{glassTubeDatasheet}.
    With the dispersion relation $n(\lambda)$ the approximation ~\eqref{eq:TheoVerdetCurve} can
    be used to calculate the theoretical wavelengths.
    The theoretical values are displayed in ~\autoref{tab:verdetConstants} and ~\autoref{fig:fyVerdetPlot}.
    
    A big discrepancy is evident between the theoretical values and the measured.
    A cause may be the manual method of finding the intensity minimum, since as mentioned above,
    the intensity function $cos^(\Theta)$ flattens at the extrema.
    It introduces systematical errors not only because you have to manually judge the minimum, but
    also because diffuse light from different sources may seemingly shift the minimum.
    
    The experiment could be improved by, instead of manually searching for the intensity minimum,
    measuring the intensity for the entire polarizing filters' angle range.
    As demonstrated in ~\autoref{subsec:MalusLaw}, you then fit Malus' law and from it infer 
    the angle offset $\Theta$.
    It would require to record the data electronically, due to the large amount of data points.
    
    Further the accuracy could be increased by utilizing a laser.
    It has a far smaller spectral width than the monochromators.
    
    Lastly a stronger magnetic field and a longer dielectric would also increase the precision.
