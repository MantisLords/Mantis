        We present a method for studying the fundamental polarization properties of electromagnetic waves in
        the visible spectrum.
        First we want to introduce a setup, with which we can create and observe linear and
        circular polarized light.
        We use conventional polarizing filters to create linear polarized light.
        By appling the Jones' formalism, we can derive Malus' law, which we
        then show experimentally.
        Furthermore, with \quaterWavePlates we produce circular polarized light.
        We demonstrate its properties qualitatively.
        
        In the second part, we showcase two exemplary applications.
        Since sugar molecules are chiral, they are optical active, meaning a
        sugar solutions rotates linear polarized light.
        We measure the specific optical rotation of sucrose $\specRot = \sugarSpecificOpticalRotation$
        with a half-shade polarimeter and then apply it for determining the concentration of 
        an unknown sucrose solution.
        
        Similar to optical activity of chiral molecules functions the Faraday effect.
        Here we apply a magnetic field at a \NSF-glas tube and shine linear polarized light
        through it.
        We gauge the space-resolved magnetic field with a hall sensor and then measure the rotated 
        polarization vector of the transmitted light with a linear polarizing filter.
        We determine Verdet's constant for three wavelengths $\VOne = \verdetConstantOne$,
        $\VTwo = \verdetConstantTwo$ and $\VThree = \verdetConstantThree$.

    \section{Methods to create and detect polarized light}
    \subsection{Introduction}
    In classical physics light is described as an electromagnetic wave.
    The electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the propagation direction.
    The polarization refers to the direction of the electric field.
    If the wave is linear polarized, the field oscillates in a fixed plane.
    If the wave is circular polarized, the field vector rotates around the propagation direction.
    
    The polarization of light can be described with the Jones' formalism~\cite{gerth}.
    Linear polarized light is denoted with a real vector, pointing in the polarization direction.
    For example vertical and horizontal polarized light:
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{J}_H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad
        \vec{J}_V = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    
    Furthermore, left and right circular polarized light are described with a complex vector:

    \begin{align*}
        \vec{J}_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix} \quad
        \vec{J}_R = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    
    Optical devices such as polarizing filters and \quaterWavePlates are described with matrices, which act
    upon the polarization vector $\vec{J}$. 
    
    \subsection{Linear polarization -- Malus' law}
    
    \figMalusFit{
    Linear v-polarized light is shone upone a polarizing filter, which is rotated around the angle $\Theta$.
    The resulting intensity is measured by a photo diode. 
        Its output current, which is proportional to the intensity, is depicted in the graphic.
    The intensity follows Malus' law ~\eqref{eq:theoMaluslaw}.
    We fit it in the dataset, with the default intensity $I_0$ and the offset angle $\Theta_0$ as
    free parameters.
    It is evident that Malus' law holds.
    This method can be used to determine the polarization angle $\Theta_0$ of a linear
    polarized light source as for example in ~\autoref{subsec:Faraday}
    }
    
    A linear polarizing filter is denoted in Jones' formalism with the matrix:
    \begin{align*}
        P_{\Theta} = \begin{pmatrix} sin^2\Theta & - cos\Theta sin\Theta \\
                        - cos\Theta sin\Theta & cos^2\Theta \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    Where $\Theta$ is the angle between the polarizing filter and the y-axis.
    If we let v-polarized light shine on the polarizing filter, it will be partially be absorbed.
    We can get the resulting intensity by calculate the magnitude of the Jones' vector:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:theoMaluslaw}
        \vec{J} &= P_{\Theta} \vec{J}_V = \begin{pmatrix} -cos\Theta sin\Theta \\
                                               cos^2\Theta\end{pmatrix} \\
        I &\propto | \vec{J} |^2 = cos^2(\Theta) 
    \end{align}
    This is Malus' law.
    We want to verify this law.
    
    In our setup we use an incandescent electric lamp, which emits unpolarized light in the full
    visible range.
    We polarize it by placing a linear polarizing filter in front of the lamp.
    A second polarizing filter, the analysator, is mounted behind that.
    It is rotated about the angle $\Theta$ relative to the first polarizing filter.
    A photo diode detects the resulting intensity.
    We measure its output current, which is proportional to the intensity.
    
    The data is shown in ~\autoref{fig:MalusFit}.
    We fit the function:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:malusFit}
        I = I_0 cos^2(\Theta + \Theta_0)
    \end{align}
     Where $I_0$ and $\Theta_0$ denote free parameters.
    From the graphic it is evident, that the data follows Malus' law.
    
    An application of this law is to determine the polarization angle $\Theta_0$ of an unknown
    linear polarized light source.
    By rotating the analysator around the whole $360\degree$ range and measuring the
    resulting intensity, the unknown angle $\Theta_0$ can be determined.
    This method could be applied in the Faraday experiment of ~\autoref{subsec:Faraday}.
    
    Furthermore, another improvement would be to make $I_0$ not a free parameter, but to calculate it
    via the photo diode's device specifications.
    This would enable more quantitative statements.
    Here we are satisfied with the simpler method,
    since the qualitative results do suffice for the purposes of this paper.
    
    \subsection{Circular polarization}
    
    In a circular polarized, electromagnetic wave, the electric field vector rotates around the
    propagation direction of the wave.
    Circular polarized light can be created by shining diagonal polarized light upon a \quaterWavePlate.
    A \quaterWavePlate consists of an optical anisotropic material, where the propagation speed for
    v-polarized light, differs in comparison to h-polarized light.
    This results in a phase shift between the x- and y-component of the electromagnetic wave.
    If the \quaterWavePlate has the right thickness, so the shift between the x- and y-component
    is exactly $\frac{\pi}{2}$, we can convert d-polarized light into circular polarized light.
    
    In Jones' formalism a \quaterWavePlate is represented by the matrix:
    \begin{align*}
        Q_{\frac{\lambda}{4}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix} 
    \end{align*}
    If d-polarized light is shone upon the \quaterWavePlate it is converted to right circular light:
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{J} &= Q_{\frac{\lambda}{4}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
        \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    This only works if the light has the right wavelength $\lambda$, matching the 
    \quaterWavePlate.
    
    To demonstrate this relationship, we mount an interference filter before our lamp
    to get monochromatic light: $\lambda = \wavelengthYellow$.
    After it, we mount a linear polarizing filter to produce d-polarized light.
    Then the \quaterWavePlate is installed with a relative angle of $45 \degree$ to the polarizing filter.
    The resulting circular light can then be observed with a second linear polarizing filter, the analysator.
    For any orientation of the polarizing filter, the same amount of light passes through.
    The \quaterWavePlates we used in our experiment, are optimized for Natrium-D-Lamps,
    so for light of the wavelength $\lambda = 589 \nm$.
    This means we do not actually get circular polarized light, but elliptical light.
    We observe it, when rotating the analysator, the light passing through varies, depending on
    the orientation of the analysator.
    
    By placing a second \quaterWavePlate behind the first one, we get a \halfWavePlate.
    A \halfWavePlate can described with:
    \begin{align*}
        Q_{\frac{\lambda}{2}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    It has the effect, that it mirrors linear polarized light around the y-axis.
    
    We can demonstrate it by shing light with a polarization angle $\Theta$ and observing 
    that the resulting light has the polarization $-\Theta$.
    Again we have the problem that monochromatic light from the interference filter, has
    not the correct wavelength for the \halfWavePlate.
    This means we also get slightly elliptical polarized light.
    
    This experiment could be improved by using a laser instead of an interference filter,
    since the interference filter has a bandwidth of wavelengths.
    In contrast, a laser is monochromatic, with only a very small bandwidth.
    
    \subsection{Birefringence with a calcite crystal}

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Positively_birefringent_material}
        \centering
        \caption{
        The graphic shows the principle of birefringent materials.
        We have a optical anisotropic material, where p-polarized light is refracted
        differently than s-polarized light.
        The s-polarized light is parallel to the optical axis (and is in the graphic called
            `parallel polarized').
        It is refrected under a greater angle and becomes the extraordinary ray,
            while p-polarized light sees a smaller refractive index and results in
        the ordinary ray. Image source~\cite{birefringenceGraphic}}
        \label{fig:birefringent}
    \end{figure}
    
    In optical anisotrop materials, the refractive index differs for light polarized
    parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis.
    This leads to the effect of birefringence, where the incoming light ray is split into 
    two -- an ordinary and extraordinary ray.
    The effect is shown in ~\autoref{fig:birefringent}.
    In the graphic one may observe that s-polarized light is greater refracted,
    resulting in the extraordinary ray,
    while p-polarized light has a smaller refractive angle.
    
    In our experiment we mount a calcite crystal, which is fixed inside a fringe,
    before our incandescent lamp. 
    We observe two light ray on the detection screen.
    The ordinary and extraordinary ray can be distinguished by rotating the cristal.
    We observe that the extraordinary ray rotates around the ordinary, since it has a 
    greater refractive angle.
    If we mount a linear polarizing filter after the calcite crystal, we can see that both rays are
    polarized, with a perpendicular polarization direction.
    
    For the experiment one has to pay attention that the incoming light ray is neither parallel nor
    perpendicular to the optical axis of the calcite crystal. 
    In both cases you would not see the split-up between the ordinary and extraordinary ray,
    since then you would only have one refractive index for the ray.
    
    \section{Applications}
    In the first part we showcased simple setups to create and detected polarized light.
    In the second part we now want to present two possible applications of those setups,
    for investigating advanced effects.
    \subsection{Optical activity}
    A chiral molecule does not posses an intrinsic mirror symmetry.
    If you have a solution with a greater amount of one type than its mirrored counterpart,
    the solution is optical active.
    It means right circular light has a different refractive index than left circular light.
    If you shine linear polarized light through an optical active solution, the
    polarization vector gets tilted around a specific angle $\Delta \Theta$.
    The angle $\Delta \Theta$ depends on the distance $l$ travelled through the solution,
    the concentration of the molecule $c$, and the specific optical rotation $\alpha$:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:specificOpticalRotation}
        \Delta \Theta = \alpha \, c \, l
    \end{align}
    The specific optical rotation $\alpha$ depends on the molecule and the wavelength of the light.
    
    In our experiment we want to determine the specific rotation of sucrose.
    For this, we use our incandescent lamp and mount the $\wavelengthYellow$ interference monochromator
    before it.
    Then the light is polarized with a linear polarizing filter and shines through
    a glas tube, containing the sugar solution.
    The glas tube has the length $l = \sugarGlasTubeLength$.
    The tilted angle $\Delta \Theta$ is then measured with a half-shade polarimeter.
    
    A half-shade polarimeter is a device consisting of two linear polarizing filters, which are mounted
    with a relative angle $\Delta \varphi$ next to each other.
    We first want to determine the relative angle $\Delta \varphi$ and the default angle $\Theta_0$ of
    the light's polarization vector.
    To do this, we remove the glas tube, containing the sugar solution, and measure the angle 
    $\varphi_1$, where the first polarizing filter lets all light pass, and $\varphi_2$, where
    the second filter lets all light pass.
    From a measurement series containing five data-points, we can determine the relative angle
    and the default angle:
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta \varphi & = \varphi_2 - \varphi_1 & = & \quad \halfShadowAngle \\
        \Theta_0 & = \frac{\varphi_1 + \varphi_2}{2} & = & \quad \defaultAngle
    \end{align*}
    The errors are derived from the variance of the measurement series and then propagated with
    the variance formula~\cite{errorPropagation} (also refered as gaussian error propagation).
    This procedure is always applied unless stated otherwise.
    
    We now want to measure the specific optical rotation.
    We insert the glas tube back into the apparatus.
    It contains a sugar solution with a concentration $c = \referenceConcentration$.
    We now measure the angle $\Theta$ of the rotated polarization vector.
    We do this by rotating the two polarizing filters of the polarimeter, so both let the same amount of
    light pass (they appear with the same brightness).
    We can calculate the relative rotation $\Delta \Theta$ and with equation ~\eqref{eq:specificOpticalRotation}
    we can determine the specific optical rotation:
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta Theta &= \Theta - \Theta_0 &= \referenceRotationAngle \\
        \specRot &= \sugarSpecificOpticalRotation
    \end{align*}
    
    The resulting value is consistent with the literature value:
    \begin{align*}
        [\alpha]_{589\nm} = 6.65 \unit{\frac{\degree \, cm^2}{g}} ~\cite{instr}
    \end{align*}
    The slight deviation can be contributed to the fact that for the literature value natrium-D-light
    is used, while we use a monochromator with $\lambda = \wavelengthYellow$.
    
    With the measured specific optical rotation we can measure an unknown sucrose concentration.
    We use a thinned-down solution from a different team.
    We measure the rotation angle and with ~\eqref{eq:specificOpticalRotation} we can determine
    the concentration:
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta \Theta &= \testRotationAngle \\
        c &= \sugarTestConcentration
     \end{align*}
    Unexpectedly we see that the concentration is in fact greater than before.
    The group, who gave use their solution, contributed it to the fact that there was some sugar left
    inside the glas with which they have thinned downed their sugar solution. 
    So actually increasing the concentration.
