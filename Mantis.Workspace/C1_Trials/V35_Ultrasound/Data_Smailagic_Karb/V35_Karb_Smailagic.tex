    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introdction}
    Ultrasound are mechanical waves with a frequency beyond $f = 20\,$kHz.
    Since the coupling between the atoms and molecules is highly dependent on the type of material, their propagation speed varies in different materials.
    The speed of the waves can also depend on the orientation of the crystal structure of the material, since the underlying symmetry also plays a role in the wave dispersion properties.
    On top of that, they can form longitudinal and transverse waves in the material, which generally have different dispersion properties.
    The goal of this paper is to understand the properties of ultrasound waves in different materials, while trying to see where the limitations of this method lie.
    
    
    
    \section{Basic functions of the echoscope}\label{BasicFunctions}
    An echoscope is a ultrasonic measurement system which uses ultrasound probes, commonly made of a piezocrystal, connected to a computer or oscilloscope.
    The piezocrytal converts a voltage into mechanical vibration and vice versa.
    Therefore the probe can be used as an emitter and receiver of ultrasound.
    Naturally, there are two modes in which the echoscope can work.
    Either in reflection mode, where a single probe functions as an emitter and a receiver, or in transmission mode, with two different probes at either side of the examined material.
    
    \subsection{Runtime measurement}\label{RuntimeMeasurement}
    To determine the propagation velocities of ultrasound in different materials, we use the echoscope in reflection mode and record the time difference between the 
    rising edges of the initial and the reflected pulse.
    Using that time difference and the measured length of the used materials, the velocity can be determined.
    \begin{equation}
        v_s = \frac{2d}{t}
    \end{equation}
    This was done for example cylinders of different lengths made of polyacryl and PVC .
    The frequency of the ultrasound was varied, in order to test the materials on the frequency dependence of the propagation velocity.

    From the determined velocities we are not able to say with certainty, if the frequency dependence exists.
    This is due to the fact, that the values coincide within the errors.
    For a more sophisticated statement, one would need to a broader frequency range.
    Comparing the determined velocities with literature values is unreasonable, since the exact composition of the used materials is not known.

    \end{figure}    
    Our way of doing the runtime measurement requires us being able to differentiate the two peaks of the signal.
    Naturally, we would have a hard time analyzing very thin materials since the two peaks in the signal would overlap considerably.
    On top of that, 
    In order to measure the propagation velocity for these types of materials, we use a different setup.
    This setup, which can be seen in \autoref{fig:AufbauWasser}, uses the physics of wave refraction.
    For that, a block of copper or aluminum is placed in a water bath on a rotating rig.
    The echoscope is set to transparency mode and the two probes are placed on the opposite ends of the bath.
    By varying the angle of the blocks relative to the probes, we can determine the propagation velocity of the waves in the material.
    By knowing the angle of the incoming and the refracted wave \textit{Snells} law can be used to determine the velocities.
    \begin{equation}\label{eg:SnellLaw}
        \frac{sin(\beta)}{sin(\alpha)} = \frac{v_s}{v_w}
    \end{equation}
    Where $v_w$ is the speed of sound in water and $v_s$ the speed of sound in the examined material.
    This method also allows a much more sophisticated setup for examining the dispersion properties of different directions inside the material.
    All metals have a specific periodic ordering of atoms.
    Depending on the symmetries of this ordering, as well as the types of bonds between the atoms, the crystal exhibits different propagation velocities of mechanical waves.
    By performing the measurement, we know that we expect three peaks - one for each mode.
    The first peak, corresponding to the fastest velocity, is that of the longitudinal mode.
    The second and third peak are the transverse modes.
    We know from theory, that for $\beta = 90^\circ$ there is total reflection for both the transverse and the longitudinal modes.
    So when the signal on the echoscope vanishes, we can approximate the refracted angle $\beta$ to be $90^\circ $, and use it to calculate $v_s$.
    Similarly, we know that transmission for transverse waves becomes maximal at $\beta = 45^\circ $.
    Using that, we can calculate another velocity value.
    The measured intensities for copper and aluminum are depicted in \autoref{fig:CopperPlot} and \autoref{fig:AluminumPlot} respectively.
    \begin{figure}
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{Generated/LongTransPlotCopper}

            \caption[]{AluminumPlot}
            \label{fig:AluminumPlot}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    From the angle values depicted in the figures, the propagation velocities of the different modes could be determined.
    It is important to mention, that we were not able to differentiate the second transverse peak from the first one.
    This is due to the fact that the peaks on the echoscope overlapped significantly, making it impossible to tell one from another.
    Nevertheless, the determined values seem to be around the same value as the theory would suggest \autoref{}.
    Keeping in mind, that the theoretically calculated values stem from the approximation that the bonds between the atoms behave according to \textit{Hooks} law.

    \section{Absorption of ultrasound}\label{sec:Absorbtion}
    When traveling through a material, ultrasound waves oscillate the atoms and molecules of the material.
    This oscillation leads to energy loss in the form of dissipated heat.
    So an initial ultrasound signal sent into one end of a material will get partially absorbed i.e. damped.
    In order to account for that in our measurement, we used the \textit{time gain control} (TGC) function of the echoscope,
    which amplifies signals after some time.
    This makes it possible to measure signals which would otherwise be to small while not overamplifying the visible signals.
    The dampening of the signal inside a material generally follows an exponential decay
    \begin{equation}\label{eg:Absorbtion}
        I(x) = e^{-\lambda x}
    \end{equation}
    where $\lambda$ is the material-specific dampening coefficient.
    By measuring the intensity of the ultrasound signal over a known distances x, the dampening coefficient can be calculated via
    \begin{equation}\label{eg:AbsCoeff}
        \lambda = -log(\frac{A_x}{A_0}) \frac{1}{2x}
    \end{equation}
    This mesurement was done for PVC for different frequencies. 
    The values can be seen in \autoref{tab:DampeningCoeff}.

            \rule[-5pt]{0pt}{23pt}    2   & \DampeningTwoMHz     \\

        \label{tab:DampeningCoeff}                             
    \end{table}
    The absorption coefficient is larger for higher frequencies.
    This is due to the fact, that the higher frequency wave oscillates the atoms faster which leads to more heat radiation and ultimately more dissipation.
    The absorption for $4\,$MHz could not be determined because the reflected signal was to small to measure accurately.
    
    
    
    \section{Resolution of ultrasound imaging}\label{sec:Resolution}
    The echoscope works by sending finite length pulses through the material.
    Naturally, if these finite pulses overlapped to some extent, it would be hard to separate them in the measurement.
    This can pose a problem when trying to separate reflection sources which are to closer than the pulse width.
    A general mean of quantifying the resolution of devices is the \textit{Full width half maximum} or FWHM of the pulses.
    The criterium for distinguishing two peaks would be: \textit{If the peaks are seperated by more that the FWHM, they are distinguishable}.
    The FWHM of our used \textit{Echoskop GS200} was measured for three different frequencies and the results are depicted in \autoref{tab:FWHM}
    \begin{table}[htbp]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular*}{0.9\linewidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}cc}
            \hline
            \hline

            \rule[-5pt]{0pt}{23pt}    2   &    $1.15 \pm 0.05$  \\
            \rule[-5pt]{0pt}{23pt}    4   &   $0.75 \pm 0.05$  \\
            \hline
            \hline
        \end{tabular*}
        \normalsize
        \caption[]{Full width half maximum values of ultrasound pulses at different frequencies.
        The measurement was done with the cursor difference in A-Scan mode on a \textit{Echoskop GS200}.
        The used material was a polyacryl test block which can be seen in \autoref{}.
        It is visible from the data, that a higher frequency results in a better resolution.}
        \label{tab:FWHM}
    \end{table}
    
    As we already know from wave mechanics, a higher frequency i.e. a smaller wavelength results in a better resolution.
    So choosing a higher frequency for measurements that require a high resolution would be the right thing to do.
    However, higher frequencies also get absorbed more (\autoref{sec:Absorbtion}) leading to a less accurate measurement.
    A balance between these two effects is a must for reliable results.
